# Secure your Azure AI Content Safety deployment

Azure AI Content Safety is an AI service that detects harmful user-generated and AI-generated content in applications and services. When deploying this service, it's important to follow security best practices to protect data, configurations, and infrastructure from unauthorized access and ensure compliance with content moderation requirements.

This article provides guidance on how to best secure your Azure AI Content Safety deployment.

## Network security

Network security is foundational for protecting Azure AI Content Safety resources from unauthorized access and establishing secure communication boundaries for content moderation workloads.

- **Enable private endpoints**: Eliminate public internet exposure by routing traffic through your virtual network. Private endpoints provide secure, private connectivity that keeps your content moderation service isolated from the public internet. See [Configure Azure AI services virtual networks](/azure/ai-services/cognitive-services-virtual-networks).

- **Configure virtual network integration**: Implement virtual network service endpoints or private endpoints to control network access to your Content Safety resources and prevent unauthorized network-based attacks. See [Configure Azure AI services virtual networks](/azure/ai-services/cognitive-services-virtual-networks).

- **Restrict network access with firewall rules**: Configure network access controls to limit which IP addresses and network ranges can access your Content Safety service. This reduces the attack surface and prevents unauthorized access attempts. See [Azure AI Services resources should restrict network access](/azure/ai-services/security-controls-policy).

## Identity and access management

Identity and access management controls ensure that only authorized users and applications can access Content Safety resources with appropriate permissions for content moderation operations.

- **Use Microsoft Entra ID authentication**: Replace access keys with Microsoft Entra ID authentication to leverage centralized identity management, conditional access policies, and advanced security features. Managed Identity is automatically enabled when you create a Content Safety resource. See [Authenticating with Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/ai-services/authentication?tabs=powershell#authenticate-with-azure-active-directory).

- **Implement role-based access control (RBAC)**: Assign users and applications the minimum required permissions using built-in roles such as Cognitive Services User or Cognitive Services Contributor rather than using administrative roles. This principle of least privilege reduces the impact of compromised accounts. See [Role-based access control guide](/azure/role-based-access-control/quickstart-assign-role-user-portal).

- **Configure managed identities for service connections**: Use system-assigned or user-assigned managed identities to authenticate Content Safety with other Azure services without storing credentials in code. This eliminates credential management overhead and improves security posture. See [Azure AI services authentication](/azure/ai-services/authentication).

## Data protection

Data protection mechanisms safeguard sensitive content processed by Azure AI Content Safety, including text, images, and content moderation results through encryption and secure handling practices.

- **Enable customer-managed keys for encryption at rest**: Configure Azure Key Vault with customer-managed keys (CMK) for encrypting data at rest when regulatory compliance requires additional control over encryption keys. Customer-managed keys provide greater flexibility to create, rotate, disable, and revoke access controls. See [Azure AI Content Safety encryption of data at rest](/azure/ai-services/content-safety/how-to/encrypt-data-at-rest).

- **Ensure encryption in transit**: Verify all communications use HTTPS and TLS 1.2 or higher encryption for data in transit between applications and the Content Safety service. This prevents eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks on sensitive content. See [Security for Azure AI services](/azure/ai-services/security-features).

- **Implement proper content handling**: Validate and sanitize all input content to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity. Never assume that upstream content is already validated or safe for processing. See [What is Azure AI Content Safety?](/azure/ai-services/content-safety/overview).

## Logging and monitoring

Logging and monitoring provide visibility into Content Safety service usage, security events, and operational health for detecting and responding to potential threats.

- **Enable diagnostic logging**: Configure diagnostic settings to capture detailed logs of Content Safety API calls, authentication events, and service operations. Store logs in Azure Monitor or Azure Storage for security analysis and compliance auditing. See [Azure AI services authentication](/azure/ai-services/authentication).

- **Monitor content filtering activities**: Implement monitoring for content moderation results, blocked content patterns, and filtering effectiveness to detect unusual usage patterns or potential security issues. See [What is Azure AI Content Safety?](/azure/ai-services/content-safety/overview).

- **Set up security alerts**: Configure Azure Monitor alerts for suspicious activities such as unusual API usage patterns, failed authentication attempts, or configuration changes to detect potential security incidents early. See [Security for Azure AI services](/azure/ai-services/security-features).

## Compliance and governance

Compliance and governance controls ensure Azure AI Content Safety deployments meet regulatory requirements and organizational policies for content moderation and data protection.

- **Implement Azure Policy for configuration enforcement**: Use Azure Policy definitions to audit and enforce security configurations across Content Safety resources and ensure compliance with organizational standards. See [Azure Policy Regulatory Compliance controls for Azure AI services](/azure/ai-services/security-controls-policy).

- **Apply Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark controls**: Implement security controls from the Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark to address common vulnerabilities and maintain consistent security posture across AI services. See [Azure security baseline for Azure AI services](/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/cognitive-services-security-baseline).

- **Document content moderation policies**: Maintain clear documentation of your content filtering policies, configurations, and procedures to support compliance audits and demonstrate adherence to regulatory requirements for content safety. See [What is Azure AI Content Safety?](/azure/ai-services/content-safety/overview).

## Backup and recovery

Backup and recovery strategies protect Content Safety configurations and ensure business continuity for content moderation operations during service disruptions.

- **Deploy across multiple regions for availability**: Configure Content Safety resources in multiple Azure regions to maintain service availability during regional outages or capacity constraints. Implement multi-region deployment strategies for business continuity. See [Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery considerations](/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/business-continuity-disaster-recovery).

- **Backup configuration settings**: Regularly export and backup your Content Safety configuration settings, custom category definitions, and blocklist configurations to enable rapid restoration in case of accidental changes or service issues. See [What is Azure AI Content Safety?](/azure/ai-services/content-safety/overview).

- **Test recovery procedures**: Regularly test your disaster recovery procedures including configuration restoration and service failover to ensure they work effectively when needed during actual incidents. See [Customer-enabled disaster recovery](/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/disaster-recovery).

## Service-specific security

Azure AI Content Safety provides unique security capabilities designed specifically for content moderation workloads and harmful content detection.

- **Configure content filtering thresholds**: Customize content filtering sensitivity levels and categories based on your organization's risk tolerance and use case requirements. Properly tuned filters improve both security and user experience by reducing false positives while maintaining protection. See [Harm categories](/azure/ai-services/content-safety/concepts/harm-categories).

- **Implement custom blocklists**: Create and maintain custom blocklists to enhance protection against content specific to your organization or industry. Custom blocklists provide additional control over content that may not be caught by standard filtering policies. See [Use blocklist](/azure/ai-services/content-safety/how-to/use-blocklist).

- **Enable protected material detection**: Configure detection for copyrighted text and code to prevent intellectual property violations and ensure compliance with content licensing requirements. Protected material detection helps maintain legal compliance in content moderation workflows. See [Protected material concepts](/azure/ai-services/content-safety/concepts/protected-material).

- **Utilize prompt injection protection**: Enable jailbreak detection features to identify and block attempts to manipulate AI systems through crafted prompts. This protects against prompt injection attacks that could bypass content safety measures. See [Prompt Shields concepts](/azure/ai-services/content-safety/concepts/jailbreak-detection).

- **Monitor Content Safety Studio access**: Implement appropriate access controls for Content Safety Studio and monitor usage for security purposes. Restrict Studio access to authorized personnel and audit configuration changes made through the interface. See [What is Azure AI Content Safety?](/azure/ai-services/content-safety/overview).
