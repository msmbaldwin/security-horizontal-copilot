# Secure your Azure Functions deployment

Azure Functions provides capabilities to run event-driven, serverless compute code without explicitly provisioning or managing infrastructure. When deploying this service, it's important to follow security best practices to protect data, configurations, and infrastructure.

This article provides guidance on how to best secure your Azure Functions deployment.

## Network security

Network security controls prevent unauthorized access to function endpoints and establish secure communication boundaries between your functions and external services.

- **Deploy function apps to virtual networks**: Integrate your function app with Azure Virtual Networks to control network traffic and secure access to backend resources. Virtual network integration enables your functions to access resources in private networks while protecting against internet-based attacks. See [Azure Functions networking options](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-networking-options).

- **Enable private endpoints for inbound access**: Eliminate public internet exposure by using Azure Private Link to route client traffic through your virtual network. Private endpoints provide a private IP address from your virtual network, effectively bringing your function app into your virtual network perimeter. See [Using Private Endpoints for Web Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/networking/private-endpoint).

- **Configure access restrictions with IP filtering**: Define priority-ordered lists of allowed or denied IP addresses to control inbound traffic to your function app. Use IPv4 and IPv6 addresses or specific virtual network subnets with service endpoints to create granular access controls. See [Azure App Service access restrictions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/app-service-ip-restrictions).

- **Secure the storage account with virtual network restrictions**: Replace the default storage account with one secured by virtual network service endpoints or private endpoints to protect function runtime data and prevent unauthorized storage access. See [Restrict your storage account to a virtual network](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-networking-options#restrict-your-storage-account-to-a-virtual-network).

- **Deploy in App Service Environment for maximum isolation**: Use Azure App Service Environment (ASE) to run functions in a fully isolated and dedicated environment with configurable network security controls and a single front-end gateway for authentication. See [Integrate your ILB App Service Environment with the Azure Application Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/environment/integrate-with-application-gateway).

## Identity and access management

Identity and access management controls ensure that only authorized users, applications, and services can invoke functions and manage function app resources.

- **Enable App Service Authentication and Authorization**: Configure authentication using Microsoft Entra ID and other identity providers to protect function endpoints beyond basic access keys. This provides centralized identity management and supports custom authorization rules. See [Authentication and authorization in Azure App Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/overview-authentication-authorization).

- **Use managed identities for service connections**: Configure system-assigned or user-assigned managed identities to authenticate to other Azure services without storing credentials in code or configuration. Managed identities eliminate credential management overhead and provide automatic secret rotation. See [Use managed identities for App Service and Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/overview-managed-identity).

- **Implement role-based access control (RBAC)**: Use Azure RBAC to provide fine-grained permissions for function app management operations. Assign users the minimum required roles such as Contributor, Owner, or Reader based on their responsibilities. See [Azure security baseline for Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/functions-security-baseline).

- **Secure function access keys properly**: Rotate function access keys regularly and store them securely when needed for backward compatibility or specific integration scenarios. Consider using Azure Key Vault to manage function keys for enhanced security. See [Work with access keys in Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/function-keys-how-to).

- **Disable administrative endpoints when not needed**: Set the `functionsRuntimeAdminIsolationEnabled` site property to `true` to disable the `/admin` endpoints and prevent unauthorized administrative access to function management operations. See [Securing Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/security-concepts#disable-administrative-endpoints).

## Data protection

Data protection mechanisms safeguard sensitive information processed by functions through encryption, secure storage, and proper handling of secrets and configuration data.

- **Enable customer-managed keys for encryption**: Configure customer-managed key (CMK) encryption using Azure Key Vault to maintain control over encryption keys for application data at rest. This provides additional protection beyond Microsoft-managed encryption. See [Encrypt your application data at rest using customer-managed keys](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/configure-encrypt-at-rest-using-cmk).

- **Use Azure Key Vault for secrets management**: Store connection strings, API keys, and other secrets in Azure Key Vault instead of application settings. Use Key Vault references to retrieve secrets at runtime while maintaining centralized secret management. See [Use Key Vault references for App Service and Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/app-service-key-vault-references).

- **Enforce HTTPS for all communication**: Redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS to ensure all data transmission uses TLS encryption. Configure TLS 1.2 or higher as the minimum version and disable legacy SSL/TLS protocols to protect against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. See [Enforce HTTPS](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/configure-ssl-bindings#enforce-https).

- **Implement proper data validation**: Validate all input data from triggers and bindings in your function code to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity. Never assume that upstream data is already validated or sanitized. See [Securing Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/security-concepts#data-validation).

- **Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictively**: Define specific allowed origins for CORS instead of using wildcard entries to prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests and reduce cross-site scripting attack risks. See [Securing Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/security-concepts#restrict-cors-access).

## Logging and monitoring

Comprehensive logging and monitoring provide visibility into function executions, security events, and performance metrics to enable threat detection and operational oversight.

- **Enable Application Insights integration**: Configure Application Insights to collect telemetry, logs, performance, and error data from function executions. Application Insights provides automatic anomaly detection and powerful analytics tools for security monitoring and troubleshooting. See [Monitor Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-monitoring).

- **Configure diagnostic settings**: Enable diagnostic settings to stream function app logs and metrics to Azure Monitor Logs, storage accounts, or Event Hubs for centralized analysis and long-term retention. This supports security investigations and compliance requirements. See [Monitoring Azure Functions with Azure Monitor Logs](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-monitor-log-analytics).

- **Set up Azure Monitor alerts**: Configure alerts for suspicious activities including failed authentications, unusual execution patterns, high error rates, and resource consumption anomalies. Use action groups to enable automated response to potential security incidents. See [Monitor Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/monitor-functions).

- **Enable Microsoft Sentinel for advanced threat detection**: Stream function logs to a Log Analytics workspace and connect Microsoft Sentinel for enterprise-level threat detection, correlation, and automated response capabilities. See [What is Microsoft Sentinel](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/overview).

- **Monitor Azure Activity Log for administrative changes**: Track subscription-level events including function app creation, configuration changes, and administrative actions. Configure alerts for critical changes that could impact security posture. See [Monitor Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/monitor-functions#azure-activity-log).

## Compliance and governance

Compliance and governance controls ensure function app deployments meet regulatory requirements and organizational policies through proper configuration management and audit capabilities.

- **Apply Azure Policy for configuration enforcement**: Use Azure Policy definitions to audit and enforce security configurations across function app resources. Implement policies for network restrictions, authentication requirements, and encryption standards. See [Azure Policy Regulatory Compliance controls for Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/functions-security-baseline#asset-management).

- **Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud monitoring**: Use Defender for Cloud to provide security assessments, vulnerability scanning, and configuration recommendations for function apps. Premium plans offer enhanced security features including advanced threat protection. See [Defender for App Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-app-service-introduction).

- **Implement continuous security validation**: Integrate security validations into CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps or other deployment tools to ensure security controls are maintained throughout the development lifecycle. See [Secure your Azure Pipelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/security/overview).

- **Configure conditional access policies**: Use Microsoft Entra conditional access policies to control access to function app management interfaces based on user identity, location, device compliance, and risk assessment. See [Securing Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/security-concepts).

- **Maintain audit trails and compliance documentation**: Ensure comprehensive logging captures all function app administrative actions, configuration changes, and access attempts for regulatory compliance and security investigations. See [Azure security baseline for Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/functions-security-baseline).

## Backup and recovery

Backup and recovery strategies protect function app code and configuration while ensuring business continuity through proper disaster recovery planning and multi-region deployment strategies.

- **Implement automated deployment from source control**: Use continuous deployment from Azure DevOps, GitHub, or other source control systems to ensure function code and configurations can be quickly redeployed after incidents. Maintain infrastructure as code for complete environment recreation. See [Continuous deployment for Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-continuous-deployment).

- **Configure geo-redundant storage for function dependencies**: Use geo-redundant storage (GRS) or read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) for the storage accounts that support your function apps to protect against regional disasters. See [Storage considerations for Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/storage-considerations).

- **Deploy across multiple regions for critical workloads**: Implement multi-region deployments using Azure Traffic Manager or Azure Front Door to provide automatic failover capabilities during regional outages. Consider active-passive or active-active configurations based on business requirements. See [Disaster recovery and geo-distribution in Durable Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-disaster-recovery-geo-distribution).

- **Back up application configurations and secrets**: Regularly export and securely store function app configurations, application settings, and connection strings. Use Azure Resource Manager templates or Azure CLI scripts to automate configuration backup and restore processes. See [Azure Functions deployment technologies](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-deployment-technologies).

- **Test disaster recovery procedures**: Regularly test backup and recovery procedures to validate recovery time objectives and identify gaps in disaster recovery planning. Document recovery procedures and update them based on test results and changing business requirements. See [Best practices for reliable Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-best-practices).

## Service-specific security

Azure Functions provides unique security capabilities designed specifically for serverless computing scenarios, event-driven architectures, and microservices patterns.

- **Set usage quotas to prevent resource exhaustion**: Configure daily execution quotas for Consumption plan functions to prevent malicious code from causing excessive resource consumption and billing charges. Monitor quota usage to detect unusual execution patterns. See [Estimating Consumption plan costs](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-consumption-costs).

- **Secure deployment credentials and processes**: Use managed deployment credentials instead of basic authentication for function deployments. Disable FTP deployment and use secure deployment methods such as ZIP deployment or container deployment. See [Configure deployment credentials for Azure App Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/deploy-configure-credentials).

- **Implement proper error handling and logging**: Write comprehensive error handling in function code to prevent sensitive information exposure through error messages. Ensure errors are logged appropriately without revealing system internals to potential attackers. See [Azure Functions error handling](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-error-pages).

- **Disable remote debugging in production**: Turn off remote debugging features in production environments to prevent unauthorized code access and debugging sessions. Only enable remote debugging temporarily during active troubleshooting activities. See [Securing Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/security-concepts#disable-remote-debugging).

- **Organize functions by security privilege level**: Separate functions with different security requirements into different function apps to minimize the blast radius of credential compromise. Use function chaining to pass data between functions in different security contexts. See [Securing Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/security-concepts#organize-functions-by-privilege).

- **Use Azure API Management for enhanced API security**: Deploy Azure API Management (APIM) in front of HTTP-triggered functions to provide additional authentication, rate limiting, request transformation, and monitoring capabilities. See [Use Azure API Management (APIM) to authenticate requests](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/security-concepts#use-azure-api-management-apim-to-authenticate-requests).
