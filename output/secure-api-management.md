# Secure your API Management deployment

Azure API Management provides capabilities to publish, secure, transform, maintain, and monitor APIs across all environments including hybrid and multicloud deployments. When deploying this service, it's important to follow security best practices to protect data, configurations, and infrastructure.

This article provides guidance on how to best secure your Azure API Management deployment.

## Network security

Network security controls establish secure communication boundaries for API Management and protect against unauthorized access to your API gateway and management endpoints.

- **Deploy API Management in a virtual network**: Enhance security and isolation by placing your API Management service in a non-internet routable network that you control access to. This allows secure connectivity to backend services and enables advanced network security configurations. See [Use a virtual network to secure inbound or outbound traffic for Azure API Management](/azure/api-management/virtual-network-concepts).

- **Configure private endpoints for inbound connections**: Eliminate public internet exposure by routing client traffic through your virtual network using Azure Private Link. Private endpoints provide secure, dedicated network interfaces that connect directly to API Management while preventing data exfiltration. See [Connect privately to API Management using an inbound private endpoint](/azure/api-management/private-endpoint).

- **Disable public network access to service configuration endpoints**: Improve security by restricting connectivity to service configuration endpoints like the direct access management API, Git configuration management endpoint, and self-hosted gateways configuration endpoint. This prevents unauthorized administrative access. See [Azure security baseline for API Management](/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/api-management-security-baseline#network-security).

- **Implement web application firewall protection**: Deploy Azure Application Gateway or Azure Front Door with Web Application Firewall in front of API Management to filter malicious traffic and protect against common web vulnerabilities. This provides an additional security layer before traffic reaches your API gateway. See [Deploy API Management in an internal virtual network with Application Gateway](/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-integrate-internal-vnet-appgateway).

- **Configure network security groups with restrictive rules**: Apply Network Security Groups to control traffic flow to and from your API Management subnet by implementing deny-by-default policies with specific allow rules for required communication patterns. See [Configure NSG rules for API Management](/azure/api-management/api-management-using-with-vnet#configure-nsg-rules).

## Identity and access management

Identity and access management controls ensure that only authorized users and applications can access API Management resources with appropriate permissions.

- **Use Microsoft Entra ID for authentication**: Replace API key authentication with Microsoft Entra ID to leverage centralized identity management, conditional access policies, and advanced security features. This provides better security through multi-factor authentication and eliminates long-lived secrets. See [Protect an API in Azure API Management using OAuth 2.0 authorization with Azure Active Directory](/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-protect-backend-with-aad).

- **Enable managed identities for service connections**: Configure system-assigned or user-assigned managed identities for API Management to authenticate to other Azure services without storing credentials in code or configuration. This eliminates the need to manage API keys for service-to-service communication. See [Use managed identities in Azure API Management](/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-use-managed-service-identity).

- **Implement role-based access control (RBAC)**: Use Azure RBAC to provide fine-grained access control for API Management services and entities. Assign users the minimum required permissions using built-in roles rather than administrative roles to follow least-privilege principles. See [How to use Role-Based Access Control in Azure API Management](/azure/api-management/api-management-role-based-access-control).

- **Configure OAuth 2.0 authorization for fine-grained access**: Implement OAuth 2.0 authorization with Microsoft Entra ID or other identity providers to enable more granular access control to APIs based on user identity, roles, and scopes. Use this as part of a defense-in-depth strategy. See [Authenticate and authorize access to Azure OpenAI APIs using Azure API Management](/azure/api-management/api-management-authenticate-authorize-azure-openai).

- **Validate authentication tokens using policies**: Configure validate-jwt or validate-azure-ad-token policies to ensure that API requests include valid authentication tokens with required claims and audiences. This prevents unauthorized access to backend services. See [Validate JWT policy](/azure/api-management/validate-jwt-policy).

## Data protection

Data protection mechanisms safeguard sensitive information processed through API Management, including API configurations, certificates, and traffic encryption.

- **Enable TLS 1.2 or higher for all communications**: Configure secure Transport Layer Security protocols and disable insecure TLS versions to protect data in transit. Use TLS 1.3 when supported by your clients for enhanced security. See [Manage protocols and ciphers in Azure API Management](/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-manage-protocols-ciphers).

- **Implement client certificate authentication for backend services**: Secure access to backend APIs using client certificates and mutual TLS authentication. Store certificates in Azure Key Vault with automatic rotation to eliminate credential management overhead while maintaining strong authentication. See [Secure backend services by using client certificate authentication in Azure API Management](/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-mutual-certificates).

- **Configure client certificate validation for API access**: Require client certificates for API access to provide strong authentication beyond API keys. Use policy expressions to validate certificate properties including issuer, subject, and expiration against trusted certificate authorities. See [How to secure APIs using client certificate authentication in API Management](/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-mutual-certificates-for-clients).

- **Store secrets and certificates in Azure Key Vault**: Use Azure Key Vault integration for secure storage and management of certificates, API keys, and connection strings. Key Vault provides centralized secret management with access policies and automatic certificate rotation. See [Use Azure Key Vault in API Management to access backend services](/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-properties#key-vault-secrets).

- **Implement certificate thumbprint and name validation**: Enable SSL certificate validation for all backend API calls to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and ensure you're connecting to trusted services. Configure policies to verify certificate details against expected values. See [Azure security baseline for API Management](/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/api-management-security-baseline#identity-management).

## Logging and monitoring

Comprehensive logging and monitoring provide visibility into API Management operations, security events, and performance metrics to enable threat detection and operational oversight.

- **Enable diagnostic settings for comprehensive logging**: Configure diagnostic settings to collect Gateway Logs and WebSocket Connection Logs for security analysis and troubleshooting. Send logs to Azure Monitor Logs, storage accounts, or Event Hubs for centralized analysis and long-term retention. See [Monitor Azure API Management with Azure Monitor](/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-use-azure-monitor#resource-logs).

- **Configure Azure Monitor alerts for security events**: Set up alerts for suspicious activities including failed authentication attempts, unusual traffic patterns, certificate validation failures, and service availability issues. Use action groups to enable rapid response to potential security incidents. See [Set up alerts on metrics in Azure API Management](/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-use-azure-monitor#set-up-an-alert-rule).

- **Enable Microsoft Defender for APIs**: Activate Defender for APIs to provide advanced threat detection, security recommendations, and full lifecycle protection for APIs managed in API Management. This provides AI-powered security insights and automated threat response capabilities. See [Enable advanced API security features using Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/azure/api-management/protect-with-defender-for-apis).

- **Monitor Azure Activity Log for administrative changes**: Track subscription-level events including resource creation, configuration changes, and administrative actions through Azure Activity Log. Configure alerts for critical changes such as network access rule modifications or service configuration updates. See [Azure security baseline for API Management](/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/api-management-security-baseline#logging-and-threat-detection).

- **Implement request and response monitoring**: Use Application Insights integration to capture detailed telemetry about API requests, performance metrics, and error patterns. This provides insights for security analysis, capacity planning, and operational troubleshooting. See [How to integrate Azure API Management with Azure Application Insights](/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-app-insights).

## Compliance and governance

Compliance and governance controls ensure API Management deployments meet regulatory requirements and organizational policies through proper configuration management and oversight.

- **Implement Azure Policy for configuration enforcement**: Use built-in Azure Policy definitions to audit and enforce security configurations such as virtual network deployment, public network access restrictions, and authentication requirements. Policies help maintain consistent security posture across environments. See [Azure Policy Regulatory Compliance controls for Azure API Management](/azure/api-management/security-controls-policy).

- **Configure conditional access policies**: Implement Microsoft Entra conditional access policies to control access to the API Management developer portal and management APIs based on user identity, location, device compliance, and risk level. This provides additional security layers beyond basic authentication. See [Azure security baseline for API Management](/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/api-management-security-baseline#privileged-access).

- **Enable audit logging for API operations**: Configure comprehensive audit logging to track API usage, policy changes, and administrative operations. Maintain audit trails for security investigations, compliance reporting, and forensic analysis of security incidents. See [Monitor Azure API Management with Azure Monitor](/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-use-azure-monitor).

- **Implement API authentication and authorization policies**: Ensure all API endpoints enforce authentication to prevent unauthorized access and data exposure. Configure policies to validate API keys, OAuth tokens, or client certificates for every API operation. See [Azure security baseline for API Management](/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/api-management-security-baseline#identity-management).

- **Configure developer portal security**: Secure access to the API Management developer portal by enabling Microsoft Entra ID authentication, restricting anonymous access when appropriate, and implementing proper user management practices. This ensures controlled access to API documentation and testing capabilities. See [Secure access to the API Management developer portal](/azure/api-management/secure-developer-portal-access).

## Backup and recovery

Backup and recovery strategies protect API Management configurations and ensure business continuity through proper data protection and disaster recovery planning.

- **Implement automated backup procedures**: Configure automated backup operations using the API Management REST API or PowerShell cmdlets to regularly backup service configurations to Azure Storage accounts. Backups protect against data loss and enable recovery from configuration errors. See [How to implement disaster recovery using service backup and restore in Azure API Management](/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-disaster-recovery-backup-restore).

- **Deploy multi-region API Management for high availability**: Implement multi-region deployments with traffic routing through Azure Traffic Manager or Azure Front Door to provide automatic failover during regional outages. This ensures continuous API availability for critical workloads. See [Deploy Azure API Management service to multiple Azure regions](/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-deploy-multi-region).

- **Configure zone redundancy for resilience**: Enable zone redundancy in supported regions to automatically replicate API Management instances across availability zones within the same region. This provides protection against zone-level failures without manual intervention. See [Reliability in Azure API Management](/azure/reliability/reliability-api-management).

- **Secure backup storage with managed identities**: Use managed identities to authenticate backup operations to Azure Storage accounts instead of storage access keys. This eliminates credential management overhead and provides better security for backup procedures. See [How to implement disaster recovery using service backup and restore in Azure API Management](/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-disaster-recovery-backup-restore#access-using-managed-identity).

- **Test disaster recovery procedures regularly**: Regularly test backup and restore operations, failover procedures, and recovery time objectives to ensure they meet business requirements. Document recovery procedures and validate that all critical configurations and dependencies are properly restored. See [Operations management considerations for the API Management landing zone accelerator](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/app-platform/api-management/management#business-continuity-and-disaster-recovery).

## Service-specific security

API Management provides unique security capabilities designed specifically for API gateway operations, policy enforcement, and developer portal management.

- **Configure API-level security policies**: Implement granular security controls using API Management policies including rate limiting, IP filtering, request validation, and response transformation. These policies provide defense-in-depth protection at the API level beyond gateway-level controls. See [API Management policies](/azure/api-management/api-management-policies).

- **Implement subscription key management and rotation**: Use API Management subscriptions to control access to APIs through subscription keys with regular rotation schedules. Implement separate subscriptions for different environments and applications to limit blast radius of compromised keys. See [Subscriptions in Azure API Management](/azure/api-management/api-management-subscriptions).

- **Configure named values for secure secret management**: Use named values (formerly called properties) to store configuration values, connection strings, and secrets that can be referenced in policies. Store sensitive values as secrets and integrate with Azure Key Vault for enhanced security. See [How to use named values in Azure API Management policies](/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-properties).

- **Enable CORS policies with restrictive settings**: Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies with specific origin allowlists, methods, and headers rather than permissive wildcard settings. This prevents unauthorized cross-origin requests while supporting legitimate client applications. See [Cross-domain policies in Azure API Management](/azure/api-management/api-management-cross-domain-policies#cors).

- **Implement backend service authentication**: Configure authentication policies to securely connect API Management to backend services using managed identities, client certificates, or OAuth tokens. This eliminates hardcoded credentials and provides secure service-to-service communication. See [Authentication and authorization to APIs in API Management](/azure/api-management/authentication-authorization-overview).
