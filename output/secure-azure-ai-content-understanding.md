# Secure your Azure AI Content Understanding deployment

Azure AI Content Understanding provides capabilities to process and extract insights from documents, images, videos, and audio using generative AI into user-defined output formats. When deploying this service, it's important to follow security best practices to protect data, configurations, and infrastructure.

This article provides guidance on how to best secure your Azure AI Content Understanding deployment.

## Network security

Network security controls prevent unauthorized access to Content Understanding resources and establish secure communication boundaries for content processing workloads.

- **Enable private endpoints**: Eliminate public internet exposure by routing traffic through your virtual network using Azure Private Link. Private endpoints provide secure, private connectivity that keeps your content processing service isolated from the public internet. See [Configure Azure AI services virtual networks](/azure/ai-services/cognitive-services-virtual-networks).

- **Disable public network access**: Block all internet-based connections when using private endpoints by configuring the service to deny public network access. This forces all communication through private endpoints and reduces your attack surface. See [Configure Azure AI services virtual networks](/azure/ai-services/cognitive-services-virtual-networks).

- **Configure IP address restrictions**: Implement service-level firewall rules to restrict access to specific IP addresses or ranges when private endpoints aren't feasible. This provides network-based access control to limit exposure to authorized networks. See [Configure Azure AI services virtual networks](/azure/ai-services/cognitive-services-virtual-networks).

- **Use network security groups**: Apply Network Security Groups to control traffic flow to and from subnets hosting private endpoints by implementing restrictive rules that deny unauthorized access while allowing necessary communication patterns. See [Network Security Groups overview](/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview).

## Identity and access management

Identity and access management controls ensure that only authorized users and applications can access Content Understanding resources with appropriate permissions for content processing operations.

- **Use Microsoft Entra ID authentication**: Replace API key authentication with Microsoft Entra ID to leverage centralized identity management, conditional access policies, and advanced security features. Content Understanding supports both Azure AD and Entra ID authentication for enhanced security. See [Authenticate requests to Azure AI services](/azure/ai-services/authentication).

- **Implement role-based access control (RBAC)**: Assign users and applications the minimum required permissions using built-in roles such as Cognitive Services User or Cognitive Services Contributor rather than using administrative roles. This principle of least privilege reduces the impact of compromised accounts. See [Authenticate with Azure Active Directory](/azure/ai-services/authentication?tabs=powershell#authenticate-with-azure-active-directory).

- **Use managed identities for service connections**: Configure system-assigned or user-assigned managed identities to authenticate Content Understanding with other Azure services without storing credentials in code. Managed identities eliminate credential management overhead and provide automatic secret rotation. See [Authenticate requests to Azure AI services](/azure/ai-services/authentication).

- **Disable local authentication methods**: Avoid using API keys for data plane access when possible and instead use Azure Active Directory as the default authentication method. Local authentication methods fall short in complex scenarios that require Azure RBAC. See [Azure security baseline for Azure AI services](/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/cognitive-services-security-baseline#identity-management).

## Data protection

Data protection controls ensure that content processed by Content Understanding and extracted results are properly encrypted and secured against unauthorized access.

- **Leverage automatic encryption at rest**: Content Understanding automatically encrypts all data at rest using Microsoft's AES-256 encryption by default. Customer data is always encrypted with service-managed keys, with the option to use customer-managed keys for enhanced control. See [Data, privacy, and security for Content Understanding](/azure/ai-foundry/responsible-ai/content-understanding/data-privacy).

- **Ensure data in transit encryption**: All communication to and from Content Understanding is automatically encrypted using TLS 1.2. This includes API requests and responses, ensuring that content and extracted results are protected during transmission. See [Transport Layer Security](/azure/ai-services/security-features?tabs=command-line%2Ccsharp#transport-layer-security-tls).

- **Configure data loss prevention**: Implement data loss prevention controls to monitor and restrict data movement by configuring the list of outbound URLs that Content Understanding resources are allowed to access. This creates an additional layer of control to prevent data exfiltration. See [Configure data loss prevention for Azure AI services](/azure/ai-services/cognitive-services-data-loss-prevention).

- **Implement workload isolation**: Content Understanding processes requests in logically isolated, sandboxed containers to ensure workload separation and prevent cross-tenant data exposure. While compute resources aren't dedicated per customer, this isolation provides security boundaries. See [Data, privacy, and security for Content Understanding](/azure/ai-foundry/responsible-ai/content-understanding/data-privacy).

## Logging and monitoring

Logging and monitoring controls provide visibility into Content Understanding operations and enable detection of security incidents and policy violations.

- **Enable Azure Monitor diagnostics**: Configure diagnostic settings to capture Content Understanding API calls, performance metrics, and error conditions. Send logs to Azure Monitor Logs or Azure Storage for analysis and retention according to your compliance requirements. See [Monitor Azure AI services](/azure/ai-services/diagnostic-logging).

- **Implement activity logging**: Use Azure Activity Log to track administrative operations on Content Understanding resources including configuration changes, access policy modifications, and resource management actions. Regularly review activity logs for unauthorized changes. See [Azure Activity Log](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log).

- **Configure security monitoring**: Deploy Microsoft Defender for Cloud to monitor Content Understanding resources for security vulnerabilities and compliance violations. Enable security recommendations and implement automated responses to security alerts. See [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-cloud-introduction).

- **Monitor API usage patterns**: Track Content Understanding API usage patterns to detect anomalous behavior such as unusual request volumes, unauthorized access attempts, or data exfiltration patterns. Implement alerting for suspicious activity. See [Monitor Azure AI services](/azure/ai-services/diagnostic-logging).

## Compliance and governance

Compliance and governance controls ensure that Content Understanding deployments meet regulatory requirements and organizational policies for data handling and privacy.

- **Implement Azure Policy controls**: Use Azure Policy to audit and enforce security configurations across Content Understanding resources. Deploy policy definitions to ensure consistent security settings and compliance with organizational standards. See [Azure Policy built-in policy definitions for Azure AI services](/azure/ai-services/policy-reference).

- **Configure Customer Lockbox**: Enable Customer Lockbox for scenarios where Microsoft support needs to access your data. This provides an approval workflow for Microsoft data access requests and ensures you maintain control over when and how your data is accessed. See [Azure security baseline for Azure AI services](/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/cognitive-services-security-baseline#privileged-access).

- **Implement content filtering policies**: Configure Content Understanding's built-in content filtering system to detect and handle potentially harmful content in both input prompts and output completions according to your organization's policies and regulatory requirements. See [Transparency note: Content Understanding](/azure/ai-foundry/responsible-ai/content-understanding/transparency-note).

- **Establish data retention policies**: Define and implement data retention policies that comply with regulatory requirements. Content Understanding temporarily stores data during processing, so ensure your policies account for processing times and result storage. See [Data, privacy, and security for Content Understanding](/azure/ai-foundry/responsible-ai/content-understanding/data-privacy).

## Backup and recovery

Backup and recovery controls ensure business continuity and protection of Content Understanding configurations and processed content against data loss or service interruptions.

- **Backup analyzer configurations**: Regularly export and backup Content Understanding analyzer configurations, field schemas, and templates to prevent loss of customizations. Store backups in version control systems or secure storage locations separate from the primary deployment. See [Azure AI Content Understanding terminology](/azure/ai-services/content-understanding/glossary).

- **Implement multi-region deployment**: Deploy Content Understanding resources across multiple regions to ensure availability during regional outages. Configure load balancing and failover policies to maintain service continuity. See [Customer-enabled disaster recovery](/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/disaster-recovery).

- **Document recovery procedures**: Create documented recovery procedures that specify steps for restoring Content Understanding services, configurations, and processed data. Assign specific roles and responsibilities for disaster recovery operations and test procedures regularly. See [Manage AI business continuity](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/ai/manage#manage-ai-business-continuity).

- **Backup processed results**: Implement automated backup strategies for critical extracted content and analysis results. Use Azure Storage with geo-redundant replication to store backups in separate regions from primary deployments. See [Manage AI business continuity](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/ai/manage#manage-ai-business-continuity).

## Service-specific security

Content Understanding provides unique security capabilities designed specifically for multimodal content processing and AI-powered analysis workloads.

- **Secure analyzer endpoint access**: Protect Content Understanding analyzer endpoints by implementing proper authentication mechanisms and ensuring API keys or tokens are securely managed. Rotate access keys regularly and store them in Azure Key Vault for enhanced security. See [Data, privacy, and security for Content Understanding](/azure/ai-foundry/responsible-ai/content-understanding/data-privacy).

- **Implement field validation controls**: Configure field extraction schemas with proper validation rules to ensure extracted data meets security and quality standards. Use field descriptions to guide model behavior and prevent extraction of sensitive information when not intended. See [Best practices for Azure AI Content Understanding](/azure/ai-services/content-understanding/concepts/best-practices).

- **Control face recognition capabilities**: When using face capabilities in Content Understanding, ensure compliance with Limited Access policies and registration requirements. Implement proper consent and privacy controls for biometric data processing as required by applicable regulations. See [Azure AI Content Understanding face solutions](/azure/ai-services/content-understanding/face/overview).

- **Configure content processing boundaries**: Establish clear boundaries for content processing to prevent unauthorized analysis of sensitive documents or media. Use classification capabilities to route different content types to appropriate processing workflows with varying security controls.
