# Secure your Azure Video Indexer deployment

Azure Video Indexer provides capabilities to extract deep insights from video and audio content using advanced machine learning models. Given the sensitivity of media data—ranging from personal recordings to proprietary business content—it's important to follow security best practices to protect data, configurations, and infrastructure.

This article provides guidance on how to best secure your Azure Video Indexer deployment.

## Network security

Network security controls prevent unauthorized access to Azure Video Indexer accounts and establish secure communication boundaries for media processing workloads.

- **Configure private endpoints**: Eliminate public internet exposure by routing traffic through your virtual network. Private endpoints provide secure connectivity between clients on your virtual network and your Video Indexer instance while maintaining full functionality. See [Private endpoints with Azure AI Video Indexer](/azure/azure-video-indexer/private-endpoint-overview).

- **Restrict storage account network access**: Configure Azure Storage accounts associated with Video Indexer using firewall rules and virtual network restrictions to prevent unauthorized access to media files and metadata. See [Set up Video Indexer with firewall-protected storage](/azure/azure-video-indexer/storage-behind-firewall).

- **Implement network security groups**: Use the VideoIndexer service tag in Network Security Group rules to control access and simplify rule management while allowing necessary communication with the Video Indexer service. See [Use network security groups with service tags](/azure/azure-video-indexer/network-security).

- **Disable public network access**: Block all internet-based connections by disabling public access and forcing all communication through private endpoints to reduce your attack surface. See [Private endpoints with Azure AI Video Indexer](/azure/azure-video-indexer/private-endpoint-overview).

## Identity and access management

Identity and access management controls ensure that only authorized users and applications can access Video Indexer resources with appropriate permissions.

- **Integrate with Microsoft Entra ID**: Use Microsoft Entra ID for centralized authentication and authorization to provide enterprise-grade identity management and seamless integration with existing identity infrastructure. See [Manage access to an Azure AI Video Indexer account](/azure/azure-video-indexer/restricted-viewer-role).

- **Enforce multi-factor authentication**: Require MFA and conditional access policies for all administrative access to reduce account compromise risk and strengthen authentication security. See [Require MFA for Azure management](/entra/identity/conditional-access/policy-old-require-mfa-azure-mgmt).

- **Implement role-based access control**: Govern access using Azure RBAC to ensure least-privilege access by assigning users only the permissions necessary for their roles. Use built-in roles like Owner, Contributor, and Video Indexer Restricted Viewer. See [Manage access to an Azure AI Video Indexer account](/azure/azure-video-indexer/restricted-viewer-role).

- **Configure managed identities**: Assign managed identities to secure access to Azure resources without storing credentials, eliminating the risk of credential exposure while maintaining secure authentication. See [Set up Video Indexer with managed identities](/azure/azure-video-indexer/storage-behind-firewall#assign-the-managed-identity-and-role).

## Data protection

Data protection controls safeguard video content, transcripts, and extracted insights both at rest and in transit throughout the processing lifecycle.

- **Enable encryption at rest**: Ensure all customer data stored in Azure including video files, transcripts, and metadata is protected using Azure Storage encryption with Microsoft-managed keys by default. See [Azure Storage encryption for data at rest](/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption).

- **Enforce encryption in transit**: Protect all data transmitted between clients and Azure Video Indexer using TLS 1.2 or higher encryption to prevent interception and ensure data integrity. See [How is network traffic encrypted by Azure AI Video Indexer?](/azure/azure-video-indexer/faq#how-is-network-traffic-encrypted-by-azure-ai-video-indexer).

- **Require secure transfer protocols**: Configure Azure Storage accounts to require secure transfer using HTTPS endpoints to prevent data transmission over unencrypted connections. See [Require secure transfer to ensure secure connections](/azure/storage/common/storage-require-secure-transfer).

- **Use customer-managed keys**: Implement customer-managed encryption keys when regulatory compliance or organizational policies require additional control over encryption key management. See [Azure Storage encryption for data at rest](/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption).

## Logging and monitoring

Logging and monitoring capabilities provide visibility into Video Indexer operations and help detect security threats and compliance issues.

- **Enable diagnostic logging**: Configure Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Activity Logs to track access patterns, indexing operations, and account activities for compliance and forensic analysis. See [Monitor Azure AI Video Indexer](/azure/azure-video-indexer/monitor-video-indexer).

- **Configure audit logging**: Enable audit logs to capture read/write operations and indexing activities, providing detailed tracking of all user actions and system operations. See [Monitor Azure AI Video Indexer](/azure/azure-video-indexer/monitor-video-indexer).

- **Integrate with Microsoft Defender for Cloud**: Enable AI threat protection to get security recommendations and threat detection capabilities specifically designed for AI services. See [Overview - AI threat protection](/azure/defender-for-cloud/ai-threat-protection).

- **Set up activity log alerts**: Create automated alerts for service health notifications to enable proactive monitoring and rapid response to service issues. See [Create activity log alerts on service notifications](/azure/service-health/alerts-activity-log-service-notifications-portal).

## Compliance and governance

Compliance and governance controls ensure that Video Indexer deployments meet organizational policies and regulatory requirements for media processing and data handling.

- **Implement Azure Policy controls**: Use Azure Policy to audit and enforce Video Indexer configurations across your organization, ensuring consistent security settings such as private endpoint usage and diagnostic logging. See [Azure Policy overview](/azure/governance/policy/overview).

- **Monitor compliance standards**: Leverage Video Indexer's compliance with platform standards including ISO/IEC 27001, SOC 1/2/3, and HIPAA when configured appropriately to meet regulatory requirements. See [Microsoft Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center).

- **Establish data residency requirements**: Understand and configure data residency settings to ensure media content and extracted insights remain within required geographic boundaries for compliance purposes. See [Azure AI Video Indexer overview](/azure/azure-video-indexer/video-indexer-overview).

- **Review Microsoft Entra ID configurations**: Regularly audit and update identity configurations to maintain security posture and ensure access controls remain aligned with organizational requirements. See [Manage access to an Azure AI Video Indexer account](/azure/azure-video-indexer/restricted-viewer-role).

## Backup and recovery

Backup and recovery practices protect against data loss and ensure business continuity for critical media assets and extracted insights.

- **Implement Azure Storage backup strategies**: Configure backup and recovery for source media files and encoded files using Azure Storage backup guidance since Video Indexer stores content in associated storage accounts. See [Azure Storage Backup and recovery](/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/storage-security-baseline#backup-and-recovery).

- **Download index results and artifacts**: Regularly export and store index results including insights and artifacts to protect against data loss and enable recovery of processed content. See [Azure AI Video Indexer overview](/azure/azure-video-indexer/video-indexer-overview).

- **Configure business continuity disaster recovery**: Set up multiple Video Indexer accounts across Azure paired regions to handle redundancy and enable failover capabilities during regional outages. See [Configure failover for disaster recovery](/azure/azure-video-indexer/video-indexer-disaster-recovery).

- **Establish organizational backup policies**: Develop and implement backup policies for trial account content and ensure compliance with organizational data retention requirements. See [Azure AI Video Indexer overview](/azure/azure-video-indexer/video-indexer-overview).

## Service-specific security

Azure Video Indexer provides unique security capabilities designed specifically for media AI workloads and content processing scenarios.
