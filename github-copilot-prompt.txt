This is for the service "Azure Key Vault": https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/, referred to here and in the inputs as <Service>.

You are generating a "Secure your <Service>" article. Use the following input files from the workspace:

inputs/prompt.txt (task instructions and generation steps)
inputs/guide.txt (writing guidance and tone)
inputs/template.txt (article structure)

Start by calling the Microsoft Docs plugin using mcp_microsoft_doc2_microsoft_docs_search with the query:
"<Service> security site:learn.microsoft.com"

Also check if a baseline exists at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/. If found, incorporate it only when it aligns with the current service documentation.

Generate the full article in Markdown, following the format in template.txt. Complete all sections fully â€” including any service-specific recommendations. Use relative links  (e.g., /azure/<service>/overview) when linking to articles on https://learn.microsoft.com.

Write the final article directly into the open Markdown file.
