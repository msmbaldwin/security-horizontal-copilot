# Feedback on Security Baseline for Azure AI Video Indexer

This document provides gentle feedback and suggestions to enhance the existing security baseline document (`security-baseline-video-indexer.md`) by incorporating best practices and organizational improvements from the autogenerated security guidance.

## Overall Assessment

The existing security baseline is well-structured and covers the essential security aspects. The suggestions below aim to enhance completeness, organization, and actionability while maintaining the document's current quality and tone.

## Content Enhancement Suggestions

### 1. Network Security Expansion
**Current:** The network security section is comprehensive but could be more actionable.
**Suggestions:**
- Add guidance on disabling public network access as a specific recommendation. See [Private endpoints with Azure AI Video Indexer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-video-indexer/private-endpoint-overview)
- Include information about Network Security Groups and the VideoIndexer service tag. See [Use network security groups with service tags](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-video-indexer/network-security)
- Provide more context about the security benefits of each configuration

### 2. Identity and Access Management Details
**Current:** Good coverage of core IAM concepts.
**Suggestions:**
- Expand the RBAC section to mention specific built-in roles (Owner, Contributor, Video Indexer Restricted Viewer). See [Manage access to an Azure AI Video Indexer account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-video-indexer/restricted-viewer-role)
- Add more context about the security benefits of managed identities. See [Set up Video Indexer with managed identities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-video-indexer/storage-behind-firewall#assign-the-managed-identity-and-role)
- Consider adding guidance on regular access reviews

### 3. Data Protection Enhancements
**Current:** Solid foundation covering encryption at rest and in transit.
**Suggestions:**
- Add a subsection specifically about secure transfer protocols and HTTPS requirements. See [Require secure transfer to ensure secure connections](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-require-secure-transfer)
- Include guidance on customer-managed keys in the main content rather than just the best practices section. See [Azure Storage encryption for data at rest](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption)
- Consider mentioning data residency requirements for compliance purposes. See [Azure AI Video Indexer overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-video-indexer/video-indexer-overview)

### 4. Monitoring and Logging Improvements
**Current:** Basic coverage of monitoring capabilities.
**Suggestions:**
- Expand to include audit logging and activity log alerts. See [Monitor Azure AI Video Indexer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-video-indexer/monitor-video-indexer)
- Add guidance on setting up proactive monitoring and alerting. See [Create activity log alerts on service notifications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-health/alerts-activity-log-service-notifications-portal)
- Consider mentioning specific monitoring scenarios (access patterns, indexing operations)

### 5. New Section Recommendations

#### Compliance and Governance
**Rationale:** The current document mentions compliance in a separate section, but governance aspects could be expanded.
**Suggestions:**
- Add guidance on Azure Policy for enforcing consistent configurations. See [Azure Policy overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview) and [Azure Policy built-in policy definitions - Video Indexer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/samples/built-in-policies#monitoring)
- Expand data residency and regulatory compliance guidance. See [Azure AI Video Indexer overview - Compliance, privacy, and security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-video-indexer/video-indexer-overview#compliance,-privacy,-and-security)
- Include information about regular compliance reviews

#### Service-Specific Security Features
**Rationale:** Video Indexer has unique security considerations not covered in generic security guidance.
**Suggestions:**
- Add section covering content filtering and moderation policies. See [Azure AI Video Indexer FAQ - Content moderation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-video-indexer/faq#i-tried-to-upload-a-video-as-public-and-it-was-flagged-for-inappropriate-or-offensive-content,-what-does-that-mean)
- Include guidance on responsible AI practices and biometric data considerations. See [Limited Access features of Azure AI Video Indexer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-video-indexer/limited-access-features) and [Transparency note for Azure Video Indexer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/azure-video-indexer/transparency-note)
- Mention API access limitations when using private endpoints. See [Private endpoints with Azure AI Video Indexer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-video-indexer/private-endpoint-overview)
- Expand trial account lifecycle management guidance

### 6. Backup and Recovery Enhancements
**Current:** Good coverage of the technical limitations and Azure Storage guidance.
**Suggestions:**
- Add guidance on business continuity and disaster recovery planning. See [Configure failover for disaster recovery](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-video-indexer/video-indexer-disaster-recovery)
- Include recommendations for regular exports of index results. See [Azure AI Video Indexer overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-video-indexer/video-indexer-overview)
- Mention multi-region deployment strategies for high availability. See [Azure paired regions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/availability-zones/cross-region-replication-azure)
