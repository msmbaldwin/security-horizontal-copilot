# Secure your <Azure service name> deployment

<Azure service> provides capabilities to <briefly describe what the service does>. When deploying this service, it's important to follow security best practices to protect data, configurations, and infrastructure.

This article provides guidance on how to best secure your Azure <service name> deployment.

## Network security

Briefly explain why network security matters for this service.

- **Use virtual networks to segment workloads**: Isolate workloads and control traffic using VNets and NSGs. See [Azure Virtual Network](/azure/virtual-network/).

- **Enable private endpoints**: Prevent public access by routing traffic through private endpoints. See [Azure Private Link](/azure/private-link/private-link-overview).

## Identity management

Briefly explain the identity risks and access requirements for this service.

- **Use Microsoft Entra for centralized identity management**: Ensure consistent authentication and access policies across services. See [Microsoft Entra](/entra).

- **Require multi-factor authentication**: Enforce MFA for all administrative access to reduce account compromise risk.

## Privileged access

Briefly explain why limiting privileged access is essential.

- **Apply least privilege with RBAC**: Assign only necessary permissions using role-based access control. See [Azure RBAC](/azure/role-based-access-control/overview).

- **Use just-in-time access via PIM**: Temporarily elevate privileges with Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management. See [PIM](/entra/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure).

## Logging and threat detection

Briefly explain the importance of monitoring and visibility.

- **Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud**: Monitor and detect threats across services. See [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/azure/defender-for-cloud/).

- **Aggregate logs in Microsoft Sentinel**: Centralize and analyze security data to detect anomalies. See [Microsoft Sentinel](/azure/sentinel/).

## Backup and recovery

Briefly explain how backups protect against data loss and outages.

- **Automate regular backups**: Use Azure Backup to protect important data and configurations. See [Azure Backup](/azure/backup/).

- **Test recovery procedures**: Periodically validate recovery processes to ensure readiness in case of failure.
