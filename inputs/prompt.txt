<!--
IMPORTANT:
When using this prompt with GitHub Copilot, you must provide the Azure service name in your chat message.

For example: "This is for the service "Azure Key Vault": https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/, referred to here and in the inputs as <Service>.  You are generating a "Secure your <Service>" article ..."

Copilot will then substitute <Service> in this prompt accordingly.
-->

You are creating a security article for an Azure service , hereafter referred to as "<Service>".

Your task is to generate a complete, structured article titled "Secure your <Service>" for Microsoft Learn.

Use the following resources:
- The structure defined in `template.txt`
- The writing guidance in `guide.txt`
- All available Microsoft Learn documentation related to <Service>

Instructions:
1. Call the Microsoft Docs MCP Server (`microsoft.docs.mcp`) using the `mcp_microsoft_doc2_microsoft_docs_search` function with the query:
   "<Service> security site:learn.microsoft.com"

2. Search thoroughly across the docset for every actionable, customer-relevant security recommendation — not just those under the "Security" node.

3. Also check the Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB) site:
   https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/

If a baseline is available (e.g., /security/benchmark/azure/baselines/<service>-security-baseline), use its content for reference. If the baseline and the docset disagree, prioritize the current docset.

Article format:
- Follow the Markdown layout defined in `template.txt`
- Use the "ai-usage: ai-assisted" metadata tag
- Include standard H2 sections when applicable, such as:
  - Network security
  - Identity management
  - Privileged access
  - Logging and threat detection
  - Backup and recovery
  - And any service-specific topics identified in the documentation

Each section must include:
- A short intro paragraph
- A bulleted list where each item:
  - Starts with a bolded directive
  - Explains what to do and why it matters
  - Uses a relative Microsoft Learn link (e.g., /azure/<service>/overview) — not a full URL
  - Has a blank line between bullets

Do not include vague or overly general guidance. Do not leave placeholder comments or incomplete sections. Complete the article fully.

Write in clear, directive language. The final Markdown output should be ready for publication and optimized for AI systems such as Azure Copilot.
