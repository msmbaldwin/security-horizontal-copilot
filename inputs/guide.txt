# Writing Standards: Security Horizontal Articles

This guide defines the specific writing style, tone, and formatting requirements for "Secure your <Service>" articles.

## Writing Style Requirements

### Voice and Tone
- **Active voice**: "Enable private endpoints" not "Private endpoints should be enabled"
- **Direct address**: Use "you" to address the reader
- **Imperative mood**: Give clear commands and directions
- **Professional tone**: Authoritative but accessible
- **Concise language**: Eliminate unnecessary words

### Language Standards
- **Directive verbs**: Start recommendations with action words (Enable, Configure, Implement, Restrict, Require)
- **Plain language**: Avoid jargon, explain technical terms when necessary
- **Exact terminology**: Use precise Azure service and feature names
- **Consistent terms**: Use the same terminology throughout the article

## Formatting Requirements

### Bullet Point Structure
Each security recommendation must follow this exact pattern:

```markdown
- **Action verb + specific control**: Clear explanation of the recommendation including why it improves security. See [Feature documentation](/azure/service/feature).
```

**Examples:**
- **Enable private endpoints**: Eliminate public internet exposure by routing traffic through your virtual network. See [Azure Private Link](/azure/private-link/private-link-overview).
- **Require multi-factor authentication**: Reduce account compromise risk by enforcing MFA for all administrative access. See [Microsoft Entra MFA](/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks).

### Link Standards
- **Format**: Use relative paths `/azure/service/feature`
- **Text**: Link text should describe the destination clearly
- **Sources**: Link only to Microsoft Learn documentation
- **Currency**: Verify all links point to current, active content
- **General links**: Use general Microsoft Learn links only when:
  - No service-specific documentation exists, OR
  - Additional context is clearly needed to understand or implement the recommendation.
  - If both service-specific and general links are included:
    - Place the service-specific link in the main sentence.
    - Add the general link as a second sentence: `See also: [General guidance – Technology or article title](/azure/general-link).`
    - Do not combine both links in the same "See ..." clause.
  - General links should rarely appear outside bullets and only when they add clear, actionable value.
  - Always reference the specific technology or full article title in the link text.
  - Never replace a service-specific link with a general one.

### Formatting Rules
- **Bold actions**: Make the action portion of each bullet **bold**
- **Spacing**: Include blank line between bullet points
- **Code formatting**: Use backticks for service names, commands, and values
- **Punctuation**: End bullets with periods, maintain parallel structure

## Content Organization Standards

### Security Domain Ordering
**Foundation-first principle**: Order domains by foundational importance to the specific service, not rigid sequence.

**Default order** (when domains have equal foundational importance):
1. Network security
2. Identity and access management  
3. Data protection
4. Logging and monitoring
5. Compliance and governance
6. Backup and recovery
7. Service-specific security

**Service-specific ordering examples:**
- **Key management services**: Service-specific security → Data protection → Identity and access management
- **Identity services**: Identity and access management → Network security → Data protection
- **Storage services**: Data protection → Network security → Identity and access management
- **Compute services**: Network security typically remains first

**Apply this ordering logic:**
1. Core service security fundamentals
2. Access control and authentication
3. Data protection and encryption
4. Infrastructure and network security
5. Operational security and monitoring

### Recommendation Ordering Within Domains
1. **Foundation first**: Basic security controls before advanced features
2. **Impact priority**: High-impact recommendations before supplementary ones
3. **Implementation flow**: Simple configurations before complex setups

## Content Quality Standards

### Service Specificity
- Include only recommendations that apply directly to the target service
- Avoid generic security advice that applies to all Azure services
- Ensure each recommendation addresses service-specific risks or capabilities

### Evidence Requirements
- Every recommendation must link to official Microsoft Learn documentation
- Base all guidance on current, published documentation
- Verify that linked documentation supports the specific recommendation

### Actionability Standards
- Provide specific implementation steps, not vague suggestions
- Include clear explanations of security benefits
- Ensure recommendations are technically implementable

## Microsoft Learn Compliance

### Style Alignment
- Follow Microsoft Learn voice and tone guidelines
- Use sentence case for headings
- Apply consistent formatting throughout
- Maintain professional, helpful tone

### Technical Accuracy
- Use exact Azure service names and feature terminology
- Verify technical accuracy of all recommendations
- Ensure compatibility with current Azure capabilities
