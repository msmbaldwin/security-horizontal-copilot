Writing Guide: Security Horizontal Articles for Microsoft Learn

This document provides guidance for writing "Secure your [Azure Service]" articles as part of the Security Horizontal initiative. It defines the structure, tone, and goals of the article format.

Purpose of the Article:
- Provide clear, actionable, customer-focused guidance on how to secure an Azure service.
- Organize recommendations under well-defined security domains (e.g., Network security, Identity management).
- Serve as a landing page under a new top-level "Security" node in the service's documentation TOC.
- Where applicable, align with the Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB) guidelines.

Article Structure:
Each article must include:

1. Metadata block
   Required value:
   ms.custom: horz-security

2. Introduction (2 short paragraphs)
   - A 2â€“3 sentence description of the service and why securing it matters.
   - A sentence like: "This article provides guidance on how to best secure your Azure [Service Name] deployment."

3. H2 Sections for Security Domains (required)
   Each domain starts with a short explanatory paragraph and contains bulleted recommendations:

   - Network security
   - Identity management
   - Privileged access
   - Logging and threat detection
   - Backup and recovery

   You may add custom sections if the service includes unique concerns (e.g., "Key management" or "Access tokens").

Bullet Format:
Each bullet must:
- Start with a bolded directive (e.g., **Use private endpoints**)
- Be written in plain, active voice
- Include a clear rationale
- Link to relevant Microsoft documentation (if available)

Example 1 (with link):
- **Enable private endpoints**: Restrict public access by using private endpoints for all inbound traffic. For more information, see [Azure Private Link](/azure/private-link/private-link-overview).

Example 2 (without link):
- **Require multi-factor authentication (MFA)**: Enforce MFA for all administrative users to reduce the risk of account compromise.

Formatting Rules:
- Include a blank line between bullets
- Do not use marketing language, vague suggestions, or redundant content
- Avoid passive voice and conditionals like "you may want to"

Writing Style:
- Use short, declarative sentences
- Prefer directive over descriptive phrasing (e.g., "Use" instead of "Consider using")
- Address the reader directly as "you," assuming they are an Azure engineer or architect
- Maintain consistency with Microsoft Learn style and voice

Goal Summary:
Every article must:
- Be actionable, specific, and relevant to the named service
- Be easy to parse by readers and AI systems (e.g., Copilot, search)
- Follow a consistent structure for predictability and reuse
